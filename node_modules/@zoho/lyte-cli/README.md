Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
npm install -g @zoho/lyte-cli@3.8.0 --registry http://integ-docker:4873

```

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create a new project

```
lyte new my-app

```

This command will create a new directory called my-app with default lyte files and folders such as routes,components,build.js(build configuration file) and bower.json(contains all the lyte dependencies and place a bower install to install the dependencies)


### Build - Compiles all the files and places them into the output folder

```
lyte build <<options>>
```

Options: 

--production(string) - In production, js files (routes, models, components etc) will be concatenated and minified as per configurations provided by the user in configuration files provided inside build folder.

--development(string) - In development, js files will be only concatenated as per configurations provided by user in json file under build folder.    

    Note : Default value is **development**.	

--watch(string) - Watches the files for changes and automatically builds the application.

    Note : Default value is **false**.	

Building of application is based on the procedures mentioned in build.js(build/build.js in the application directory, a procedure file for building application). where you can also write your own build procedures.


### Run the development server

```
lyte serve
```

This will launch a development server and serves the built app at <http://localhost:3000/> by default.Port can be changed using 

```
lyte serve --port <<port_no>>
```


### Generate - Will create required files with basic syntax.
	
```
lyte generate <<route|component|helper|mixin|test|adapter|serializer|model>> <<name>> 
```

For route generation, two optional parameters are possible lyte generate route << name >> << path >> , if not specified path will be generated based on the route name. While route generation, router.js will be updated.

```
lyte generate route <<route_name>> <<route_path>> 
lyte generate route blog /blog
lyte generate route blog.list /list //Will create a sub route inside blog route.
lyte generate route blog.view view/:blogId //A dynamic route 
lyte gnereate route blog.reviewed /blog?review=true //Default query param is passed. 
```
Specifying folders :

We can specify the folder using -d options, this is available for the all the modules except route.

```
lyte generate component <<component_name>>
lyte generate test <<test_name>> // will generate the unit test
lyte generate component blogger-comp -d blogFolder //We can also specify the folder.
lyte generate model bloglist -d blogFolder //Which will create bloglist model inside blogFolder.
```
***Note : Component name should be hyphenated. It should not contain capital letters and special character except hyphen. Similarly Helper names should not be hyphenated.***


### Destroy - Will delete the files and folders created using lyte generate command.

```
lyte destroy <<route|component|helper|mixin|test>> <<name>>
```
If you have created a component inside a folder, it is mandated to specify the same during destroy as well for example:

```
lyte destroy component blogger-comp -d blogFolder
```

### Test - Will run the specified unit test

```
lyte test // will run all the available unit tests
lyte test <<test_name>> // will run the specified unit test
lyte test <<test_name1,test_name2...>> // will run the comma seprated unit tests
```
